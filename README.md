# R - collection of convenience functions
All my R scripts which store convenience functions that can be useful in multiple R projects

agk_library.R stores all my convenience functions for everything R related; usually is read in first when working in an R script or project
to have those available.

there is still a sub folder (LA) which is an old R project. I will pull this out of here in due time.
